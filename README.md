## Hi there 👋

I'm Marco Lind — a performance-minded C/C++ programmer with a deep appreciation for simplicity, precision, and systems-level problem solving. I value clean, efficient code and enjoy getting the most out of hardware by writing tight, well-structured logic.

### 🚀 Projects I'm Proud Of

- **💧 HydroGuard** – An award-winning robust water level safety system done as a school group project. It was a challenge in both design and implementation, and I’m proud of how it balances reliability with low resource usage.
- **💡 DimmerLib** – A lightweight arduino library for dimming lights using pure C++. Compact, fast, and portable — it reflects my philosophy of minimalism and performance-first development.

### 🛠️ What I Work With

- **Languages**: C, C++, some Python, Bash, batch scripting
- **Tools**: GCC, GDB, VS Code, Git
- **Platforms**: Linux & Windows, embedded systems (ESP32-C3, Arduino R4)
- **Philosophy**: Avoid unnecessary abstractions. Write code that makes sense to both the machine *and* the person maintaining it.

### 🔍 Currently Exploring

- Custom memory allocators  
- File I/O optimization techniques  
- Retro game engines and modding  
- Low-overhead build systems and portable setups

### 💬 Ask Me About

- Structuring C (or C++) projects for performance
- Simulating OOP in C without the bloat
- Debugging weird pointer bugs
- Why `strncpy()` might not be your friend 😉

### 🤝 I’d Love to Collaborate On

- Embedded projects that demand speed and reliability
- System utilities or libraries where overhead matters
- Tools that make command-line environments better

Thanks for stopping by! I care about doing things right — not necessarily the trendy way, but the **robust** way.
